# Excel-Based-Data-Analysis-Project
This repository showcases my ability to work with organizational data using Excel tools, pivot tables, and dashboards. My goal is to present meaningful insights into company performance and demonstrate my skills in data analysis and visualization.

## **Project Overview**

This Excel project is designed to analyze key organizational metrics and visualize data through an interactive dashboard. The project contains the following components:

1. **Base Sheet**: Contains raw data from the organization.
2. **Working Sheet**: A curated data sheet derived from the Base Sheet, used for further analysis and pivot tables.
3. **Pivot Tables**: Dynamic tables created from the Working Sheet, used to summarize and analyze data.
4. **Excel Functions**: A dedicated sheet to showcase my proficiency with advanced Excel functions such as:
   - `XLOOKUP`
   - `COUNTIFS`
   - `SUMIFS`
   - `IFS`
   - Conditional formatting to visually highlight data patterns.

## **Interactive Dashboard**

The highlight of this project is an **interactive dashboard** that provides insights into organizational demographics, performance, and turnover. Features include:

- **Slicer**: Filter the dashboard by department to compare and contrast progress across different areas.
- **Charts**: Multiple visualizations, including:
   - **Demographics** (Gender, Age, Education) across the organization.
   - **Salary vs. Number of Employees** comparison.
   - **Departmental Performance Scores**.
   - **Employee Turnover** across departments.
   - Various chart types like line, bar, radius, combo (line chart), and pie charts to provide diverse perspectives on the data.

## **Key Excel Features Demonstrated**

- **Pivot Tables**: Used to summarize data by department, salary, performance, etc.
- **Excel Functions**: Demonstrated use of advanced formulas, enhancing analytical capabilities:
  - **XLOOKUP** to retrieve specific employee details.
  - **COUNTIFS** to analyze departmental performance.
  - **SUMIFS** to calculate department-specific salary totals.
  - **Conditional Formatting**: Highlights important trends (e.g., performance below average).
- **Dynamic Slicers**: Allow users to interact with the dashboard and visualize department-specific data dynamically.
